# What do I put in here?

Find unobscured frontal image and 35ish degree angle (looking left. Mirror if your image isn't facing left) image of your desired person with a neutral expression on their face (eg not laughing, smiling, talking...), name them exactly like the examples, and then run 'python foto2vam.py' (Note: It can read JPG images just fine, but it searches for PNG images. Rename a .JPG to .PNG and it'll work)

### Example Names
